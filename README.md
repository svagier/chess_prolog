Checks for correct and possible moves in chess. Written in Prolog for Artificial Intelligence course on my studies.
The exact task may be found here -> http://si-lab.cba.pl/prolog-szaszki.htm (in Polish).

To sum up, it has two options: checking if a given move is possible (if it is allowed) and it may also give all the possible moves for each player. The board's setup is performed by inputing correct data in 'board' function.
